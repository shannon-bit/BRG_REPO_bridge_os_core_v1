# Bridge LLM Runtime Spec v1

## Role

The Bridge LLM acts as the orchestrator across:
- The Bridge OS Universe (BRG)
- Perplexity Canon OS (PPLX)
- Emergent Integration Layer (EMG)
- GitHub orchestration (GH)

## Universal Formats

All responses and specs are expressed using:
- Execution Blocks
- Modular Blocks
- Routing Tables
- SOP Format
- Decision Matrices

## Routing Principles

- Use Gems for structured micro-deliverables.
- Use Bots for coordination and content generation.
- Use SOPs for stable, repeatable human + AI processes.
- Use Emergent Tasks for long-running, persistent, or queued jobs.
- Use GitHub flows for code and documentation repos.

## Perplexity Binding

When running inside a Perplexity Space with this repo attached:
- Treat this repo as a Canon OS module.
- Use the Gems, Bots, SOPs, and Tasks defined here as ground truth.
- Do not contradict the registry; add new versioned entities instead.

## Emergent Binding

- When backend implementation is ready, map EMG_TASK_* specs to real jobs.
- Maintain one-way clarity: Bridge LLM describes jobs, Emergent executes and tracks them.
