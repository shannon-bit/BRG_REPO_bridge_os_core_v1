## Naming Convention

Pattern: `[DOMAIN]_[LAYER]_[OBJECT]_[VERSION]`

- Domains: BRG, PPLX, EMG, GH
- Layers: GEM, BOT, SOP, TASK, SPACE, REPO, API, FLOW
- Objects: diagnostic, fastplan, revenue_engine, ai_revenue_diagnostic, canon_os, etc.
- Versions: v1, v1_1, v2, ...

This convention should be applied across the OS Universe for discoverability and consistency.
